# VBA-refactoring

## Overview
The overall purpose of this analysis is to analyse the performance of different stocks and to automate the calculation of performance parameters such as total volumes, starting and ending prices. The automation is done using VBA Macros. The reason for automation is to avoid repetition on 2 fronts -
* Repeating excel analysis for different stocks
* Repeating the same for another year
In this activity in particular, we are refactoring the code, meaning, we are making the code more efficient and letting it run faster than it did before. We are measuring code performance (run time) after coding, that lets us understand if it is refactored efficiently.
